# RickyHub

This project consists of a mobile application where I learned how to use and interpret the [Ricky And Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) to retrieve information and display it in the form of listings. In addition, I implemented a search engine that allows filtering characters according to specific criteria. I also added a configuration page where several additional changes can be made.

## Featured Features

### Application Logic
A package structure has been created to handle the connection and queries to the API, as well as the handling of character information. This includes classes to perform API requests, map the received data.

### Technologies Used
- **Retrofit:** This was used to simplify the management of API calls and data processing.
- **Glide:** Used for image loading, providing a smooth and efficient visual experience.
- **SharedPreferences:** Used to store and manage application configuration preferences.
- **SafeArgs Plugin:** It was installed to ensure security in the communication between fragments.
